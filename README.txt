Welcome! 

    This is our Interactive Web-based Visualisation Application. Data can be uploaded and explored. 
    if any problems occur while using the application you can contact via mail using the mail address l.vd.wijngaart@outlook.com
    
    The languages used for this project are: 
    -HTML & CSS for the website itself
    -Python for the visualisation. 
    -A lot of libraries (within Python)

    The application uses Python so when using the application locally Python 3.6.5 and pipinstaller are required
    Make sure you have all the files, these can be downloaded from Github which can be found here: https://github.com/Imran076m/dbl29

    When downloaded, open Visual Studio Code or any other IDE and open the command prompt and execute the following commands in order: 
    
    python.exe -m venv DBL
    pip install wheel
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    set FLASK_APP=app
    set FLASK_ENV=development
    flask run

    (These can also be found in the commands.txt file)

    This will run the application locally and make sure it is hosted (localhost). It will give a link in the command prompt, 
    which can be opened in your browser. And you're all ready to go!
